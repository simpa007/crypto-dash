			<h1>About Crypto Dash</h1>
			<p>
				Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual money secured by cryptography,
				operating on a decentralized network (blockchain) rather than a central
				bank, enabling peer-to-peer transactions. Bitcoin and Ethereum are
				well-known examples, used for payments, investments, or as a store of
				value, with transactions recorded on a public ledger and stored in
				digital wallets. Key features include decentralization, enhanced
				security through encryption, and high market volatility, meaning values
				can change rapidly, and it's not yet universally accepted.{" "}
